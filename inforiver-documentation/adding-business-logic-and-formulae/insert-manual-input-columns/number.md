# Number

You can create dynamic data columns in Inforiver, by inserting the data type as a number. This data type allows you to add numbers and also you can distribute the parent node value into child nodes through the systematic distribution feature.

When you select any type, you are taken to a configuration screen. Amongst several options, which are stated [as below options ](./)[ ](./)also you can define whether data entry should be restricted to edit mode, or if you would like the report consumers in reading view to be able to enter data as well.&#x20;

* **Title**: Name the number column
* **Insert as**: Select either a column or a measure to be inserted
* **Insert type:** Select the data type as a number
* **Row aggregation type**: Select the aggregation type from the drop-down list
* **Allow edit**: Allow data edit from the drop-down
* **Description:** Section to Describe the data and formula
* Click on **Create** to save the data input column
* Click on **Close** to shut the panel&#x20;

In the example below, create a column dedicated to capturing numeric values. Here, we see different elements in the distribution of the data

* Enter the numeric data on the grand total cell of the measure or column&#x20;
* Click on the distribution tab near the number value
* You can find ways to distribute the entered value

1. **Distribute Equally:** You can distribute the entered value equally between rows and column
2. **Distribute to column with trend:** You can input the trend value through the slider and customise the distribution within columns
3. &#x20;**Distribute to rows with trend:** You can input the trend value through the slider and customise the distribution of the value into the rows
4. **Distribute by weights:** based on the categories added to the value section. This report has five categories, so you have five options Average sales, Sales Forecast, PY Sales, Sales Plan
5. **Lock this cell**: You can freeze the pane by clicking on this option
6. **Lock all children**: You can freeze the cell values but you cannot edit it until it has been unlocked.

When the data input section is inserted, more options for distribution open which is copying&#x20;

Here, data can be copied into rows or columns easily with the below available options.&#x20;

**Copy until last**

* Last row or column, _leaving the previous rows or columns untouched_
* With the input trend value to the rows or columns.
* Data up to the specified levels or all rows or all columns
*

**Lock this cell**: You can lock the data in the cells to not change the data

> Only if the Row type aggregation is Sum and the check box for distribution is enabled only then the distribution is possible
