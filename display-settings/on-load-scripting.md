# On-load scripting

Inforiverâ€™s new on-load scripting feature enables you to list a set of actions to be performed on loading the visual. You can display messages, set the layout, hide columns, or apply filters as the visual is loaded. The scripts will be executed when you open the report, switch to the tab containing the visual, or refresh the visual.  Inforiver offers an array of built-in functions that you can use to set up scripts effortlessly.
