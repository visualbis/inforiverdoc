# Admin consent for Inforiver's Entra ID

Inforiver is an add-on visual that operates atop the Power BI framework. Power BI does not share user details, hence users must login with their Microsoft O365 account. Admin consent will be required to login, add writeback destinations, or connect to integrations like Teams or SharePoint.

Users may get an approval window as shown in the screenshot.

A tenant admin can provide basic access or give full admin consent by following the steps outlined:

* [Basic consent](admin-consent-for-inforivers-entra-id/basic-consent.md)
* [Full admin consent](admin-consent-for-inforivers-entra-id/full-admin-consent.md)

The user will be able to login to the Inforiver console, connect to integrations, or add writeback destinations once the admin has approved.
