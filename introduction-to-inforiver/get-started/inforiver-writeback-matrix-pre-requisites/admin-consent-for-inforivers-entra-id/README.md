# Admin consent for Inforiver's entra ID

Inforiver is an add-on visual that operates atop the Power BI framework. Power BI does not share user details, hence users must login with their Microsoft O365 account. [Admin consent](./) will be required to login, add writeback destinations, or connect to integrations like Teams or SharePoint.

Users may get an approval window as shown in the screenshot.
