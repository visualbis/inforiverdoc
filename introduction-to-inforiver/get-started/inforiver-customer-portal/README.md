## Who can access it?

The Billing and License admins can access the customer portal.&#x20;

1. **Billing Admin:** This person receives invoices and payment-related emails, can update profile info, billing and shipping details, payment methods, generate and download builds, and cancel subscriptions.&#x20;
2. **License Admin/Shipping Admin:** This person receives subscription-related emails, manages licenses and their sharing across the organization's users, and generates/downloads the latest builds as required. &#x20;

The Billing and License Admins are usually the same person, but there can be exceptions. They use separate logins, as explained in the next section.&#x20;

## How to access it?

The portal has two login options: account-based login for billing admins and subscription-based login for licensing admins. &#x20;

**Account-based login:** The Billing Admin can log in using the registered email ID as shown below. A 6-digit verification code would be sent to the registered email ID.&#x20;
