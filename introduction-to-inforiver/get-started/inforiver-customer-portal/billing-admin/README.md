# Billing Admin

Billing admins receive invoices for successful payments and other payment-related emails. After logging in, they can access the dashboard.&#x20;

The dashboard offers a unified interface for the billing admins to [update their profile](update-profile.md) and [subscription-related information](update-subscriptions.md) by clicking on the highlighted links as shown below. They can also view upcoming payment details and promotional credit balances, if any.

## View and Download Invoice&#x20;

For paid subscriptions, the dashboard looks as shown below. They can view and download the latest invoice by clicking **Download Invoice.**&#x20;

The dashboard has a dropdown menu, **Menu** with which users can switch between the pages — Profile, Subscriptions, and then back to the Dashboard.

We will now look at managing the [profile](update-profile.md) and [subscriptions](update-subscriptions.md) in the coming sections.
