# License Admin

License admins can access only the Subscriptions page after they login using their registered email ID and subscription ID. They can view the plan details and shipping information, generate the Inforiver visual for the available versions, or get the license key in case of a certified visual.&#x20;

## Generate and Download Builds/Get License key &#x20;

In the ‘Downloads/Licenses’ section, the license admin can generate and download the latest builds by clicking **Generate Build**. After the build is generated, they can click **Download**. &#x20;

The latest three versions will be available for admins to download at any time. For certified visuals, the license key can be copied from this section.&#x20;

Unlike billing admins, they cannot view invoices or change billing/subscription information. They receive emails from Inforiver to download the visual once they sign up and occasionally whenever new releases become available.&#x20;

Both admins will always have access to the most recent three versions for download. &#x20;
