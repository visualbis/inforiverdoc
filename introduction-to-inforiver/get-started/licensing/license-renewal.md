# License renewal

This section is intended for Inforiver Reporting Matrix customers who use a licensed, Microsoft-certified version of the visual from AppSource.

The Inforiver support team will share a license key file in JSON format with you.  The license needs to be applied to every Inforiver Reporting Matrix visual and has a validity of 1 year. At the end of the validity period, follow the steps outlined to apply the renewed license for all Reporting Matrix visuals in your Power BI reports(pbix files).

### 1. Power BI reports which do not have a theme applied

**STEP 1:** Navigate to the View ribbon in the Power BI toolbar > click the **Browse for themes** option from the dropdown menu.

**STEP 2:** Select the license theme file shared by the Inforiver support team.

Sample license theme file:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sample license key file</p></figcaption></figure>

**STEP 3:**&#x59;ou'll get a pop-up notification once the theme file is added:

After importing the theme file, the license key will automatically be updated in all the Inforiver Reporting Matrix visuals in that particular pbix file. The license will also be applied to any new Reporting Matrix visuals added to the Power BI report. You can verify that the license key has been updated from the Formal Visual pane.

### 2. Power BI reports which already have a theme applied

**STEP 1:** If your report already has a Power BI theme applied, you will need to export the theme by clicking the **Save current theme** option from the ribbon menu.

**STEP 2:** Open the saved Power BI JSON theme file. Append the contents of the license key shared by the Inforiver team to the theme file.

If you have both Reporting Matrix and Analytics+ visuals, you can append both license keys to the theme file. A sample Power BI theme file with the Reporting Matrix and Analytics+ licenses applied is shown below:

Follow the steps listed in the [previous section](license-renewal.md#id-1.-power-bi-reports-which-do-not-have-a-theme-applied) to import the theme file and apply the license key.
