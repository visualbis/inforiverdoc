# Licensing

When you purchase a certified Inforiver Reporting Matrix visual from AppSource, you will need to assign licenses to report developers from the [Microsoft Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/licenses).

**Who is a license admin?**

The person responsible for purchasing the Inforiver product is the license administrator. After the payment details are updated successfully, the purchaser becomes the license admin. If the purchaser intends to use Inforiver, they must assign a license to themselves as well.
