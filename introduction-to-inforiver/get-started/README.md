## 2. Inforiver website

The latest features and hotfixes are available on the Inforiver website before they are released on AppSource. You can download and install the Matrix and Enterprise visuals directly from the website if you do not require certified visuals.

### STEP 1: Download Inforiver

If you have registered for a trial of [Inforiver Matrix](https://inforiver.com/trial/) or [Enterprise ](https://inforiver.com/enterprise/trial/)from the Inforiver website or have a [paid subscription to Inforiver](https://inforiver.com/login/), you will receive an email with a link to download the visual as a .pbiviz file.

The visual is already embedded with a unique dynamically generated license key for paid subscriptions - you do not have to enter any license key in the visual.

### STEP 2:  Install Inforiver

There are 2 different methods to deploy Inforiver in Power BI:

#### 2.1 Install for yourself

* You can use this option to install the visual on your own in the Power BI desktop or service, without help from your IT or Power BI administrator.
* You must share the Inforiver build file (.pbiviz file) with additional report authors/creators if they need to use Inforiver.
* In the future, when there is a newer version of Inforiver, you need to follow the same process to update each of your reports.

#### 2.2 Install for your Organization (Organization Visual)

* Under this option, your Power BI Administrator uploads Inforiver to the **Organizational Custom Visual (OCV)**
* Once uploaded, the custom visual becomes available to all users within your organization who log on to Power BI. You need not share the build file (.pbiviz file) with every creator, they do not have to individually install or update visuals.
* Any future updates done to the visual – when uploaded to the repository by the administrator – will automatically update all the reports in your organization.
