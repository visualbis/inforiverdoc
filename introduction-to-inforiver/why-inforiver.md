### 2. End-to-end Security and Governance

Inforiver visuals are [certified](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-certified) by Microsoft. In addition, the product enables three levels of security inside your Power BI reports:

1. Security provided by your tenant / Power BI at the workspace and data levels (including RLS or row-level security)
2. Inforiver-level security - e.g., administrators can decide whether Inforiver users can write to Snowflake
3. Report-level security - e.g., report creators can authorize specific users to perform specific actions in the report, such as who can comment, enter data, create scenarios, etc.

### 3. Built for business users with no coding experience

Inforiver is a no-code product built to support business users and casual users with zero coding skills. It automates a lot of activities for you that require you to write DAX or PowerQuery scripts or create applications using Microsoft PowerApps.

You can create the following without writing a single line of code:

* Forecast templates
* Financial statements
* Commenting & collaboration
* Data writeback&#x20;
* ... and more

### 4. Get features 'highly voted' by industry peers

Inforiver delivers a variety of features that have repeatedly been [requested in Power BI idea place and community forums](https://inforiverstage.wpengine.com/blog/category/feature-highlights/).

In essence, these features are not available in Power BI today. While some can be implemented using workarounds, many of these are simply not achievable even with DAX and PowerQuery scripting.
