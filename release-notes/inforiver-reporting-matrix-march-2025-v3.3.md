### Column formatting for time hierarchies

### Aggregation

#### First and last for row aggregation

The latest version of Reporting Matrix ships with built-in support for first and last aggregation types for row-level aggregation. First and last aggregation is used to capture the starting and final values in trends - for instance, the initial and final revenue.

{% hint style="info" %}
For First and Last aggregation types, the aggregated parent row will get updated automatically when child rows are re-ordered.
{% endhint %}

### Export

#### Display negative signs in Excel export

In earlier versions, when a Reporting Matrix report was exported to Excel, manually changing positive numbers to negative numbers would not be reflected in the cells. The negative sign would be displayed only in the toolbar when the cell was clicked. This issue has been rectified in the latest version.

### Display settings

#### Enable canvas rendering

The canvas rendering option enables fast interactions with the matrix, smooth scrolling, and quick rendering. In earlier versions, users would have to explicitly enable this option. It will be enabled by default in the latest version.
