### Aggregation

#### First and last for row aggregation

The latest version of Reporting Matrix ships with built-in support for first and last aggregation types for row-level aggregation. First and last aggregation is used to capture the starting and final values in trends - for instance, the initial and final revenue.

### Export

#### Display negative signs in Excel export

In earlier versions, when a Reporting Matrix report was exported to Excel, manually changing positive numbers to negative numbers would not be reflected in the cells. The negative sign would be displayed only in the toolbar when the cell was clicked. This issue has been rectified in the latest version.
