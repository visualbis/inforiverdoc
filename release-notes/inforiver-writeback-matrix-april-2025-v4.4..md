# Inforiver Writeback Matrix April 2025 - v4.4.

### Match date periods in Infobridge

Infobridge supports forecasts and allows you to capture projections or data for future time periods. Your target reports, however, may not require future data. We've added a new **Show All Periods from Infobridge** option in the Manage Measures side pane:&#x20;

* When the toggle is enabled, all the time periods available in the bridge will be imported into the target report.
* When disabled, only the time periods in the bridge that exist in the target report will be imported.

{% hint style="info" %}
This option will be enabled only after creating an integration to a bridge
{% endhint %}
