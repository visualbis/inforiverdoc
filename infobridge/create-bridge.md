# Create bridge

A bridge is a workspace environment where you can integrate multiple reports from different data sources and transform them as required. Each bridge has a data transformation editor interface. This unified interface enables data consolidation, real-time planning, and collaboration.

A bridge can be created in two ways: from an Inforiver report, or the console. Both are explained below:

## 1. Creating bridges from an Inforiver report <a href="#id-1.-through-inforiver-console" id="id-1.-through-inforiver-console"></a>

**STEP 1:** Login to your Inforiver visual.

**STEP 2:** Click **Create Bridge** from the **InfoBridge** ta&#x62;**.** Enter a name for the bridge and select the destination folder in your workspace. Click Next.

**STEP 3:** Select the measures and scenarios required for the bridge. This allows you to regulate how much data you want to expose in a bridge.

**STEP 4:** After you confirm that the bridge can be created from the visual, you will automatically be redirected to Infobridge. You can rename the bridge by clicking the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1084).png" alt="" data-size="line">icon. When you hover over the query name, you'll see options to rename/delete/re-run the job/duplicate the query, etc.

## 2. From the console

You can also create a new bridge from the console and then add source reports to it.

1. Select **InfoBridge** from the left-side dropdown menu in the console.

2. Click **Add Bridge** to create a new bridge.

3. Enter the bridge name in the pop-up window and click **Add**.

4. A new bridge is created as shown below, where you can start adding the source reports. The steps to add a source are explained in [this section](add-source-to-bridge.md).

In the upcoming sections, we will explore how to add sources to the bridge, integrate sources into a target visual, and manage integrations.&#x20;
