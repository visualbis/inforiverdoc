# Create Bridge

A bridge is a workspace environment where you can integrate multiple reports from different data sources and transform them as required. Each bridge has a data transformation editor interface. This unified interface enables data consolidation, real-time planning and collaboration.

A bridge can be created in two ways: from an Inforiver report, or from the console. Both ways are explained below:

## 1. From Inforiver Report <a href="#id-1.-through-inforiver-console" id="id-1.-through-inforiver-console"></a>

1. Login to your Inforiver visual.

2. In the **InfoBridge** tab, click **Create Bridge.**

3. Enter a name for the bridge, select the destination folder in your workspace and click **Ok** in the pop-up window.&#x20;

4. Clicking **Yes** in the confirmation pop-up creates a new bridge. Click **OK** to navigate to the newly created bridge.

5. The bridge is created as below and the Inforiver report is added as a source query.

6. Click on the pencil icon beside the query or the bridge name to rename them. There are also other options to duplicate the query, copy the identifier, and refresh the source as highlighted below.

7. You can change the layout style as below. Click **Apply** to refresh the source and save your changes.

To learn about adding further sources to the bridge, please refer to [this section](add-source-to-bridge.md).

## 2. From the Console

You can also create a new bridge from the console and then add source reports to it.

1. Select **InfoBridge** from the left-side dropdown menu in the console.

2. Click **Add Bridge** to create a new bridge.

3. Enter the bridge name in the pop-up window and click **Add**.

4. A new bridge is created as shown below, where you can start adding the source reports. The steps to add a source are explained in [this section](add-source-to-bridge.md).

In the upcoming sections, we will explore more on adding sources to the bridge, integrating the sources and managing the integration.&#x20;
