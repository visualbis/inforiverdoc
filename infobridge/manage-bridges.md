# Manage Bridges

A visual can be added as a source in multiple bridges. The **Manage** option in the InfoBridge tab enables the user to view and manage them.

In the example below, the visual is added in three bridges. You can see the details for each bridge, including the date and time the visual was added as a source, as well as a list of all sources available in the bridge.

You can also create a new bridge from here using the **Create Bridge** option. To edit or remove the report from a particular bridge, click **Edit** beside the bridge name. You will be navigated to the respective bridge interface where you can transform, edit or delete it.
