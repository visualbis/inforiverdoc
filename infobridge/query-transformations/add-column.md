# Add Column

You can create calculated measures, dimensions, and conditional columns within Infobridge and cascade them to other reports. Let's explore the different options to create measures, dimensions, and columns in a bridge.

## 1. Add Measure

Write a custom calculation or leverage built-in Infobridge formulas to create a measure. The formula editor opens when you click the **Add Measure** option. Add references to dimensions and measures from the Reference tab. Access built-in functions from the Function tab.
