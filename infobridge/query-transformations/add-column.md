# Add Column

You can create calculated measures, dimensions, and conditional columns right within Infobridge and cascade them to target reports. The source report will remain unchanged; you can enhance it with the required dimensions and measures created in Infobridge. Let's explore the different options to create measures, dimensions, and columns within a bridge.

## 1. Add Measure

Write a custom calculation or leverage built-in Infobridge formulas to create a measure. The formula editor opens when you click the **Add Measure** option. Add references to dimensions and measures from the Reference tab. Access built-in functions from the Function tab.

Notice how a custom measure has been added to the bridge:

## Add Dimension

You can add dimensions directly in a bridge by writing an expression based on specific conditions. Enter the expression in the formula editor.
