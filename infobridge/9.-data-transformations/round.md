# Round

Rounding numeric data is important to ensure consistency and for readability. You would also need to round data to conform to industry standards.

Inforidge offers 3 options: Round, Round Up, and Round Down.\


* Use **ROUND** for standard rounding needs
* The **ROUNDUP** function always rounds a number up, away from zero. Use ROUNDUP when you always need a higher estimate, such as in budgeting or safety margins.
* The **ROUNDDOWN** function always rounds a number down, toward zero. Use ROUNDDOWN for conservative estimates, like minimizing costs.
