# Extract Comments

Inforiver facilitates collaborative reporting with its advanced comments feature. [Learn more about adding comments in Inforiver](../../working-with-inforiver/8.-commenting-and-collaboration/comments.md). Comments allow users to capture background details and perspectives that are not available in the data source and enrich your reports. You can extract and capture comments in Infobridge, enabling you to cascade comments into target reports.

The cell level comments are captured in a new "Comment" column that is added to the query. You will also be able to extract housekeeping fields like the updated by user, date/time at which the comment was added, and the thread status. The assignee is also displayed.
