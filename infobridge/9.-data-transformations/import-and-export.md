# Import and export

You may have applied a series of transformations on a particular query, and the same transformations need to be re-applied on a different query - for instance, if you get similar data from different source systems. Infobridge supports re-usability by allowing you to export transformation steps and import them into another query.

### 1. Exporting transformation steps

When you click the **Export** button from the Transform ribbon, Infobridge extracts the transformation steps and downloads them into a .bck file. The file will be downloaded to the designated folder on your machine.

### 2. Importing transformation steps

Click the Import button and choose the .bck file from your machine to import and reuse steps in a query.

The steps are imported into the target query.
