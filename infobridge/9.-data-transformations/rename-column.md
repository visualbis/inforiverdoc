# Rename column

You may need to rename your measures and dimensions within the bridge to easily identify them or conform to naming conventions followed in your target report. Additionally, when you perform operations like adding measures/dimensions or pivoting/unpivoting columns, you can use the Rename Column option to change the default names.

To demonstrate this feature, let's update the "Sum of COGS" measure to "Cost of Goods Sold". Click **Rename Column** and select the "Sum of COGS" option from the **Column** dropdown. Enter the updated column name in the **New Column Name** textbox. Click Apply.

Notice how the measure has been renamed to "Cost of Goods Sold".
