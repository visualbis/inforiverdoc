# Bridge Interface

Every bridge has a transformation editor that allows you to add sources, transform and prepare the data as required. As soon as you create a new bridge, you will be navigated to the bridge interface as below.

It has five distinct sections:

1. **Toolbar** - It consists of various menus and tabs to add and manage sources/queries, transform data, view logs, export and writeback data.
2. **Queries pane** - This pane at the left provides a list of all your available queries for integration, viewing, editing and transformation. You can select the required query to view the data in the working area and also transform them as required.
3. **Working area** - This is your main working space where you can view your data and the results of the applied transformations. At the top, there is a small menu bar with options to format the viewing style, number scaling, totals display, etc.
4. **Query Settings & Writeback pane** - When you select a query, this pane at the right displays the list of sources in the query and their respective links to navigate to them, the list of performed transformation steps, and post-processing options like writeback settings.
5. **Status bar** - The status bar at the bottom displays the total number of pages and rows in the current query. This bar also contains buttons to zoom in or out and to navigate to the different pages.

Let us discuss each section in detail in the upcoming sections.
