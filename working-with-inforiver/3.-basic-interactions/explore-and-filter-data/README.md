# Explore & filter data

When you have a large amount of data, features like search, filter & ranking can help you focus on a smaller subset based on certain conditions. In this section, we cover the following:

**1. Search & filter** - You can use the search option to look for specific words or values. Nested AND/OR filtering and column filtering can be applied to filter records based on conditions. To learn more, refer to [search & filter](search-and-filter.md).

**2. Explorer** - KPI explorer can be used to filter rows, columns and measures, sort by name or value and highlight row/column hierarchies using rules or ranges. To learn more, refer to [explorer](explorer.md).

**3. Top N** - Inforiver offers a dynamic and comprehensive Top N implementation using a no-code interface. To learn more, refer to [top N](top-n.md).
