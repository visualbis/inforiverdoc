# Budgeting & allocations

Inforiver provides an intuitive way of performing planning, budgeting & allocations through an editable table interface. You can create a new plan/budget based on an existing data series or from scratch (Zero-based Budgeting). While using hierarchies, you can spread data entered on a parent cell to its descendants (rows & columns), based on weights from other measures.&#x20;

## 1. Creating a series

Let's first look at the ways of creating a new series.

### i. From scratch (ZBB)

Let’s assume you would like to create a zero-based budget for the year 2023.&#x20;

This can be achieved by creating a data input column as mentioned in the section [create a numeric input column](insert-manual-input-columns/insert-manual-input-columns.md#1.-create-a-column).

### ii. Based on an existing series&#x20;

Let’s take an example where we would like to create a 2023 Budget based on the 2022 Budget (or the most recent forecast).

This can be achieved by creating a data input column as mentioned in the section [copy as data input](insert-manual-input-columns/insert-manual-input-columns.md#4.-copy-as-data-input).

## 2. Allocate totals

In this example, let's consider a zero-based budget for 2023.

Enter a value of 290m as the Q1 2023 Budget in the formula bar by double-clicking on the cell.

### i) Equal

### ii) Weight





## 3. Lock cells







## 4. Edit period values



### i) Trend





### ii) Copy
