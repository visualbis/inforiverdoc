# Set version

'Set version' can be used to compare two or more measures in the report and calculate absolute and percentage variances automatically. One-click variance analysis of measures such as current year, plan, forecasts or budgets using IBCS templates can also be achieved.

Click on 'Set version' in the 'Insert' tab of the toolbar. The current AC, PY, PL and FC mapping is shown along with other measures created in the visuals - such as simulations and budgets.
