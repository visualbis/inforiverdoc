# Set version

'Set version' can be used to compare two or more measures in the report and calculate absolute and percentage variances automatically. One-click variance analysis of measures such as current year, plan, forecasts or budgets using [IBCS](https://www.ibcs.com/) templates can also be achieved.

Click on 'Set version' in the 'Insert' tab of the toolbar. The current AC, PY, PL and FC mapping is shown along with other measures created in the visuals - such as simulations and budgets.

{% hint style="info" %}
AC, PY, PL and FC are IBCS terminologies for the business scenarios Actuals, Prior year, Plan and Forecast respectively. According to IBCS, scenarios with different meanings should be presented differently and they recommend the solid, outlined, hatched notationâ€‹ where AC is in black, PY in grey, PL is outlined and FC is hatched.

### 1. Prerequisite

A minimum of two series is required to enable 'Set version'.

### 2. Search a series

In case there are a large number of series in the report, use the 'Search' box to find a specific series as highlighted below.

### 3. Map measures

The default mapping can be modified by&#x20;

a) Unchecking the measures to be removed from the measures field or from the 'Series' section

b) Dragging and dropping the series in the corresponding measure field

The measure mapping is modified as shown below.

### 4. Variance analysis

Once the measure mapping is done, click on 'Variance analysis'.&#x20;

The best-suited IBCS template gets applied. In this case, the T03 Measure rows template has been used.&#x20;

If you want to visualize using a different template, you can select from the side panel. In this case, the T04 Variance waterfalls template has been used.

### 5. Manage columns

Another way to access the 'Set version' dialog box is using 'Manage columns'. Click on 'Manage columns' and then the settings icon.

Select the 'Versions' tab as shown in the image. You can see the same dialog box that was explained earlier.
