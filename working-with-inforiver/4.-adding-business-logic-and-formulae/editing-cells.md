# Editing cells

Inforiver allows you to easily edit the contents of a cell and apply calculations.

Double-click on a cell as shown in the image. A formula bar is enabled below the toolbar. Type in a value and click 'Enter'. Note that Inforiver allows entry of scaled values (e.g. 45.3m instead of 45,300,000).

The value gets updated and is highlighted in yellow. The totals and subtotals are also updated to include the value entered for the 'specialty beverages' category, which was created using the [static rows](insert-manual-input-rows.md) option.&#x20;

Let's now enter a value at the total level. Double-click on the 2021 Actuals, Grand Total field, type in the value, and press 'Enter'.

As shown in the below image, the 250m gets distributed equally to the 'International' and 'United States' columns. The category totals and the row grand total are also updated.

### i) Mathematical operations using the cell editor

&#x20;Using the cell editor, you can also define simple mathematical operations such as A +/- B, etc., or use the formulas and functions available in Inforiver. In the below example, we are using the 'Average' function. As you start typing, you can see the functions that match the entered text as a list. Click on 'Average'.

c) Let's calculate the average of the two selected cells.

d) You can see the result of the operation and it also gets distributed to the child levels.&#x20;

### ii) Updating multiple cells

You can also override the data in multiple cells with the same value, for instance, set a fixed budget. Select the cells and update the value in any cell, the updated value will get cascaded to all the selected cells.
