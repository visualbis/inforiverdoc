# Advanced Settings

In the advanced settings tab, you can enforce null checks on the data being written back. You can either exclude empty fields from writeback or prevent writeback altogether. In the Writeback settings _Advanced_ tab, the configurations listed below can be used to handle empty fields:

* Select the fields that require a null check to be performed before writing back.
* Turn on the 'Prevent writeback when data is missing' toggle to stop writeback when empty fields are detected.&#x20;

If null fields are detected during writeback, an exception notification is generated by Inforiver that gives details of empty measures/columns.&#x20;
