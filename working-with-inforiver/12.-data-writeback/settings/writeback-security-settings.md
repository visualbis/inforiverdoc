**Writeback -> Connections Page:** Lists all writeback destinations configured by all users in your organization using Inforiver. Admin has access to create new connection, edit existing connection, or delete a connection.

**Writeback -> Settings:** Allows Admin to enable/disable users to create and configure writeback destinations on their own. Because of data security and confidentiality requirements, organizations would prefer users to export data to destinations created and configured by admins. This setting will allow the admin to achieve that by disabling users to create and configure destination on their own.
