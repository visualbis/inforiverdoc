# 1. Build your first Inforiver report

This guide is designed to get you up and running with Inforiver Matrix & Enterprise as quickly as possible. If you have not already installed Inforiver, see the install guide [here](https://inforiver.com/get-started/).&#x20;

The first step to using Inforiver is to add it to the Power BI canvas. You can drag it over from the visualization pane. Resize it to fill the entire screen. Inforiver can also be used with other native and custom Power BI visuals.

Similar to using a pivot table, to use the visual you need to specify 3 things:

* Rows
* Columns (optional) and
* Values

If you’ve used pivot tables before, this experience should feel familiar. If you have experience with Power BI, then this process is identical to any other Power BI visual, especially a table or matrix visual.

Here we’ve dragged the Level 4 description to the rows field well, and the Actuals measure to the Values (AC) well. “AC” is the [IBCS](https://www.ibcs.com/) notation for “Actuals”. We have left the columns field well empty because we don’t need a matrix view for a P\&L statement.

We can see that while this produces a nicely formatted table, it doesn’t show all the information we want. Many accounting reports show a nested hierarchy of data, and a P\&L statement is no different. To make the most of Inforiver, we need to provide it with a structure to organize the data.
