# Assign & track tasks

In this section, we'll see how you can assign tasks to stakeholders and track closure status. Tracking status for comment assignments, using terms such as ‘resolved’, ‘open’, etc. is helpful when you are interacting with multiple stakeholders. &#x20;

## 1. Assign tasks

a) Let's add a column-level comment and assign it as a task. Select a column and click on 'Add a comment'.

b) Enter a comment. Click on the 'Assign a user' dropdown.

c) From the dropdown, select the desired user.

d) The status is set to 'Open'. Post the comment.

e) The task gets assigned.

## 2. Task status

a) By default, on assigning a task, it is set to 'Open'.&#x20;

b) To change the task status, click on the 'three dots' and select 'Resolve thread'.&#x20;

b) The thread is marked as resolved as shown below.&#x20;

c) Resolved tasks can be reopened if required by clicking on the 'Undo' icon. Alternatively, replying to any resolved thread will automatically make it open again.

d) Comments added in the comments column can also be assigned as tasks. Select a comment and assign it to a user.

e) By clicking on the arrow highlighted, you can expand/collapse the task status and assignee columns. Based on the selection in the comments editor, these columns get populated automatically.

## 3. Filter/view all tasks

a) To view all the tasks, click the 'Comments' dropdown and 'View All Comments'.

b) You can choose 'Resolved' to view all resolved threads, 'My threads' to view threads started by you, or 'All' to view all threads.

c) On selecting 'Resolved', the resolved tasks are shown.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (519) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Resolved tasks</p></figcaption></figure>

d) You can also filter tasks by users using the 'Assigned to’ and 'Assigned By' filters. Click on the filter, and select the name(s) you require from the dropdown to filter the tasks based on the assignee or the assigner. Click **Apply**.&#x20;

e) Users who only consume the report in the reading view and do not have edit access can also see their assigned tasks. In the **Writeback** tab, click on **My Tasks**. A side panel opens showing the list of tasks assigned to you.

In the next section, we'll cover how you can [track changes](track-changes.md) in comments and tasks.
