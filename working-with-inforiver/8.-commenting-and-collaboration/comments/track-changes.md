# Track changes

Tracking changes in the report using an interactive, filterable, and comment-enabled audit log that captures date, time, user details, task status and more is essential for â€‹data governance. This gives information such as who commented on a specific data point, and when.

a) Click on 'View all comments' from the 'Comments' drop-down.

c) Comments and tasks can be filtered by assignee, status and time period. They can also be filtered to show only your threads or show all threads.&#x20;
