# Report-level comments

In the previous sections, we discussed about adding and tracking data-level comments in a report. Inforiver also supports report-level comments, which will be covered in this section.

Data-level comments enable you to add annotations, mention users, assign tasks and perform other collaborative actions that are specific to a data point. Report-level comments, on the other hand, let you perform all the aforementioned actions while providing an overall summary of the report.

## 1. Add report-level comments

1. Click on **Comments** dropdown and then **Report Level Comments**. In the side panel, enter the comments.&#x20;

2. On clicking **Post**, the comments get displayed on the side panel. You can edit/delete the comment by clicking on the corresponding icons in the top right.

{% hint style="info" %}
All features of data-level commenting are also supported in report-level commenting, including formatting text, adding hyperlinks, [mentioning users](comments.md#id-2.-mention-other-users), [replying to comments](comments.md#id-3.-reply-to-comments), [email notifications](comments.md#id-6.-email-notifications) and [assigning tasks to users](comments-1.md#id-1.-assign-tasks).
{% endhint %}

## **2. Lock/un-lock thread**

A report-level comment that has been added can be locked to prevent further editing and replies. Click on the three-dot icon and select **Lock Thread.**&#x20;

The comment thread is locked and greyed out as below:

To unlock a thread, click on the 'Unlock' icon highlighted below, so that users can reply to and edit the thread.

## 3. Resolve/re-open thread

1. When a task is assigned, it's status is 'Open'.

2. To change the task status, click on the three dots and select **Resolve thread**.

3. The thread is marked as resolved.

4. Resolved tasks can be reopened if required, by clicking on the 'Undo' icon. Alternatively, replying to any resolved thread will automatically re-open it.

## 4. Sort/track tasks

If you want to quickly navigate through a long comment thread with multiple replies, use the 'Sort by' option to sort them from newest to oldest or vice versa.
