There are two ways to apply conditional formatting -

1. Using quick, one-click options such as quick rules, color scales, classification and data bars which are covered in [one-click options](5.-conditional-formatting/one-click-options.md)&#x20;
2. Creating advanced rules from scratch using nested if-conditions, ranking etc which are covered in [create rule](5.-conditional-formatting/create-rule-basic-settings.md)

Inserted rules can be edited, hidden, reordered or deleted using [manage rules](5.-conditional-formatting/manage-rules.md).
