# 7. Planning, budgeting & forecasting

In the previous section, we looked at the customization options available for the charts and visualizations. In this section, we'll cover the following:

**1. What-if analysis & simulations** - With Inforiver, you can create what-if scenarios and quick forecasts on the fly using a graphical slider to simulate and roll up or spread-down changes in hierarchies. To learn more, refer to [what-if analysis & simulations](../4.-adding-business-logic-and-formulae/what-if-analysis-and-simulations.md).

**2.** **Budgeting & allocations** - Inforiver provides a great way to create quick sales forecasts, business plans or financial budgets. While using hierarchies, you can spread data entered on a parent cell to its descendants (rows & columns), based on weights from other measures. To learn more, refer to [budgeting & allocations](../4.-adding-business-logic-and-formulae/budgeting-and-allocations.md).

**3. Set version** - 'Set version' can be used to compare two or more measures in the report and calculate absolute and percentage variances automatically. Inforiver also provides a one-click variance analysis of different business scenarios. To learn more, refer to [set version](../4.-adding-business-logic-and-formulae/set-version.md).
