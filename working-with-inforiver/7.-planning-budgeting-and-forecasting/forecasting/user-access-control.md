# User Access Control

You can set user permissions for reading and writing forecast data, editing forecasts, re-forecasting, closing periods, and deficit distribution.&#x20;

To set it, click on the **Manage** button in the **Forecast** tab. This opens the Forecast measure side panel, where you can set the user permissions under the 'Sharing' tab. By default, all users are permitted to do the aforementioned actions.

**Read:** Users with read access would be able to only view the data and add comments.

**Read+Write:** Users with both read and write access can modify and distribute the forecast data to leaf levels.

**Close Period Actions:** Users added here will have read/write access along with the permission to perform critical forecast actions like closing the actuals, re-forecasting, and distributing the deficit.

The access control for forecasting can also be set from the **Manage Columns** dropdown at the top just like [configuring the access control for the measures](../../4.-adding-business-logic-and-formulae/insert-manual-input-columns.md#id-3.-access-control) as shown below.
