# Common Scenarios

Let us see some common forecasting scenarios in the upcoming sections. Three use cases are illustrated with examples:

1. [Forecasting using a blank template](forecast-using-a-blank-template.md)
2. [Forecasting using existing data](forecast-using-existing-data.md)
3. [Adding periods that are not available in the model](adding-forecasts-for-periods-unavailable-in-the-model.md).
