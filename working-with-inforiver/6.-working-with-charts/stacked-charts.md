# Stacked charts

Stacked charts are often used to show the breakdown of a total, such as the distribution of expenses by category or the composition of a portfolio by asset class. They can also be used to show changes in the composition over time, such as the distribution of sales by product or region.

Inforiver offers two variations of stacked charts, they are:

* **Stacked bar chart** - In a stacked bar chart, each section of the bar represents the absolute value of each series.&#x20;
* **Percentage stacked bar chart** - In a percentage stacked bar chart, each section of the bar represents the relative proportions of the data series.&#x20;

## 1. Adding the chart

In this example, we have 2022 Actuals across regions and we want to visualize using a stacked chart.

a) We have added 'Sub Category' in the 'Columns' field, and '2022 Actuals' in the 'Values (AC)' field in the visualization pane.

b) Select columns for which you want to insert the stacked/percentage stacked chart. In the following image, all the subcategories columns have been selected.

The bullet/stacked chart option gets enabled. From the 'Bullet/Stacked chart' drop-down, select the 'Percentage stacked chart' under the 'Others' category.&#x20;

c) The percentage stacked chart gets inserted as shown below. You can see the 'Customize' tab in the toolbar and the following [customization options](stacked-charts.md#2.-customization-options).

The following customization options are available if you insert either a stacked or a percentage stacked bar chart.

Some of these customization options may or may not be available, depending on the type of stacked chart inserted.

### **i) Sorting**&#x20;

From the 'Sorting' drop-down, you can set the sorting order of the data series in the chart to either _Ascending_ or _Descending_.

Using this drop-down, you can set the alignment of the data labels within the bar. You can align the label to the _Left, Center,_ or _Right_ of the bar, the default is Left.

### iv) Appearance

This option lets you change the appearance of the stacked charts. Clicking on this option will open up an 'Appearance' model in which you can configure the following properties:

**Theme** - Using this option, you can customize the theme of the chart. The bar colors change depending on the theme chosen. It has the following options: _IBCS, Power BI,_ and _Custom_.&#x20;

* **IBCS** - Set the bar color of values to the default IBCS theme color
* **Power BI** - Set the bar color of values to the default Power BI theme color
* **Custom** - This option lets you set your own custom color for the bars

**Value 1, Value 2,...** - These drop-downs display the columns for which the stacked bar chart is inserted.
