# 11. Scheduling reports

Subscribe yourself and your team to important reports to stay updated with the latest data and insights.

Inforiver provides a high-performance, self-service scheduler that allows you to easily create new subscriptions, manage your existing subscriptions, and manage the subscriptions of your team/organization members as a workspace administrator.&#x20;

Inforiver Scheduler allows you to schedule your reports for delivery to multiple destinations, such as your email, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc. Subscriptions can be generated even for large datasets of up to 75K cells.

The key capabilities of Inforiver's subscription scheduler are as follows:

* Create a one-time or recurring schedule with flexible frequency options—e.g., specific days of the week, month, etc.
* Export highly formatted, paginated, high-resolution PDFs, PPTs, and Excel files
* Broadcast to specific users, teams, or the entire organization​.
* Select specific tabs or pages in a paginated report or send the entire report
* Use a single schedule for multiple destinations, such as email or shared drive folders.
* Merge multiple report tabs into a single PDF/Excel file and schedule the consolidated extract
* Apply row-level and column-level security to show different views to different users.
* Customize content by recipient and destination using filters and bookmarks—e.g., EMEA records for the EMEA manager.
* Bulk upload users and schedule for users outside the organization.
* Embed executive scorecards in the body of your email.
* Schedule reports containing 100+ charts and tables from Inforiver Analytics+ and Matrix.
