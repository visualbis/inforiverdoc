# 11. Scheduling reports

In Inforiver, you can easily create new subscriptions, manage your existing subscriptions and also manage the subscriptions of your team/organization members. Inforiver's subscription scheduler lets you do the following:

* Schedule entire reports, report tabs, or specific pages within a paginated report​
* Use flexible frequency options – e.g., specific days of the week, month, and more​
* Create schedules that broadcast to specific users, teams, or entire organization​
* Send embedded, high-quality executive screenshot right in the body of the email
* Send only relevant records to recipients by using filters (e.g., only EMEA records to EMEA regional manager) or by starting a dynamic subscription
* Create one schedule and configure different bookmarks for different destinations
* Merge multiple report tabs into a single PDF/Excel file and schedule the consolidated extract
