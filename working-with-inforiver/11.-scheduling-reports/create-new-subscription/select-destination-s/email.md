# Email

The configurations listed below can be used to setup an email destination.&#x20;

### **a) Recipients**&#x20;

Here you can specify the recipient's email address to which the report should be sent. AD groups can also be used.&#x20;

### **b) Filter/bookmark**&#x20;

You can specify whether you want to apply any filter or bookmark to the report for the selected recipients, before exporting it. This value is set to 'None' by default.&#x20;

You can learn more about filters and bookmarks [here](./#filter).

### **e) Report preview**&#x20;

This option shows a preview of the report with the applied filter/bookmark. You can preview the report in PDF or Excel formats.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the report size is less than 2 MB it will be displayed as an inline preview. However, if the file size exceeds 2 MB the preview report will get downloaded as a zip file.
{% endhint %}

Clicking on the preview icon will display a 'Preview available' toast message at the bottom of the page (if the report/page size is less than 2 MB).

You can select the format in which you want the report to be sent.&#x20;

Currently, we offer the following three options: 'PDF', 'Excel' and 'Preview images' of high quality.&#x20;

If you have selected either the 'All pages' option or more than one page in the 'Select' option of the 'Pages' option, then you can export the report as a merged file or as multiple files.
