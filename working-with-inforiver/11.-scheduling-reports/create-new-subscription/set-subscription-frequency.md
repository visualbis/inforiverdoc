# Set subscription frequency

Here you can specify how frequently the subscriptions should be run. The report deliveries are scheduled according to the set frequency, start date, end date, and scheduled time.&#x20;

## 1. Frequency

The frequency at which the scheduler should run. You can select from the following options:&#x20;

* **Daily:** This option schedules the reports to be sent every day. If you want to schedule once every 'x' day(s), you can input 'x' in the 'Once every' input field.

  You can also specify the exact calendar day(s) or the last day, or select frequencies such as 'First' Monday, Wednesday, and so on. The report is delivered to the chosen destinations on the selected days.
