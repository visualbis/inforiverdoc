<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1116).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Job summary</p></figcaption></figure>

### 2.3. Milestones

A milestone represents the stages within the scheduled job progress. It consists of multiple levels, with each level providing a clear indication of the job's advancement to the user.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1117).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Milestones</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Sub-Milestones

Sub-milestones refer to a group of smaller activities or tasks that, when completed, collectively contribute to achieving an individual milestone. These sub-milestones help break down larger milestones into more manageable steps, tracking progress at a granular level while still contributing to the overall goal.

Milestone details for both legacy mode and current mode subscriptions are provided below. It denotes the indication and progress for all types of jobs, such as single jobs or a parent with multiple child jobs.

#### Milestones Details

Milestones & sub-milestones will be provided with a specified time stamp to track the duration of the process. It applies to various job flows, like single jobs and parent jobs with multiple job processing.

The 'Milestones' section contains step-by-step event flow of the scheduled run as follows:

#### 1. Initial Job Data Setup

The system preprocesses the scheduled job configuration data to extract and organize the necessary information required to initiate the job. This includes:

**·** **Job Initialization:** Extracting key details from the pre-processed scheduled job configuration data to start the job execution process.

#### 2. Refresh Data Service

This process handles refreshing the dataset based on the configuration:

**· Refresh Execution:** If the **refresh dataset service** is enabled, the system updates the dataset to ensure the latest data is used before proceeding with further tasks.

**· Skip Condition:** If the refresh service is not enabled, the dataset refresh step is skipped, and the process continues with the existing data.

#### 3. Collect Page Visuals

The system processes embedding in a page-wise manner to ensure detailed tracking and configuration.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1118).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Collect Page Visuals</p></figcaption></figure>

Key steps include:

**i) Initiate Puppeteer Services**

**· Start the Puppeteer Service:** Begin by activating the Puppeteer automation system to handle tasks like embedding a PowerBI report into the process.

**· Embed the PowerBI Report:** Use Puppeteer to include the PowerBI report, ensuring it is accessible for all further actions.

**ii) Page Wise Dynamic Milestone**

* Checks for page Limit settings
* Track Page-Wise Progress: As the system works through each page, it does the following:

&#x20;            \> Takes a screenshot of the overall report page.

&#x20;            \> Records the number of visuals processed on that page to meet the condition limit.

&#x20;            \> Handles specific actions for each visual, such as, running preview services for a quick overview and exporting data to PDF or Excel formats based on needs.

**iii) Combine and Merge Services**

Combine and merge files:

For PDF or Excel files if merging is enabled,

* Merge the multiple files as per destination and store them in the desired location.
* If a layout is provided, organize the PDF into a grid format (including the report screenshot pdf file)
* Deliver the final combined document to the designated destination.

**iv) PPT Services**

Generate PPT slides:

* Use preview images generated for each page to create PowerPoint slides.
* Once the slides are ready, a PowerPoint file is generated to the designated location.

**Note:** All outputs—PPT slides, PDFs, or Excel files—are securely saved to their respective locations for easy access.

#### 4.Deliver Destinations

The system processes the selected destinations and their configurations to ensure seamless delivery of the generated files.

**· Process Destination Configuration:** Retrieve the scheduled subscription configuration to determine the destinations where the outputs need to be delivered.

**· Deliver Attachments:** Based on the configured destinations, send the generated attachments (PDFs, Excel files, PPT slides, etc.) to their respective locations.

### 2.4. Cancel parent job

If your subscription job is running long or you need to make additional modifications to your report before sending it out, you can use the Cancel Job option in the scheduler. This will immediately abort the subscription and cancel both the parent and child jobs without having to cancel each child job individually.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1181).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cancel job option</p></figcaption></figure>

You’ll notice that the status of all your jobs is changed to Failed.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1182).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 2.5. Re-run failed job

If a job run fails, then the 'Milestones' section has a 'Re-Run Job' button available at the top right corner of the section. Clicking on this option will rerun the failed job.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1119).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Re-run a failed job</p></figcaption></figure>

### 2.6. Error Details

For failed jobs, an additional section called 'Error Details' becomes available. This section contains information about errors that occurred during the job run.

The 'Error details' section has a 'Download logs' button at the top right corner of the section. Clicking on this button will download the error logs for the failed job run in a text file.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/email-download-logs.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Download logs option</p></figcaption></figure>

Here is a sample of a downloaded error log

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/email-list.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Email recipients list</p></figcaption></figure>

You can also select any of the recipients by enabling the checkbox next to their corresponding email. If any of the checkboxes are enabled, then the 'Re-run job' button becomes available at the top-right corner of the page.&#x20;

Clicking on this button will run the job only for the chosen email recipient.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/email-rerun-job.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Email re-run jobs</p></figcaption></figure>

### 2.7. Consents

This page becomes available only if the 'Refresh dataset' option is enabled during report creation.

If the 'Refresh dataset' option is enabled, then a consent email will be sent to the dataset owner emails mentioned during schedule creation.&#x20;

This page contains a list of recipients who have accepted and not accepted the consent emails.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/consent-email.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Consent email</p></figcaption></figure>
