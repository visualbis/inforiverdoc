# Basic formatting

Once you have chosen the layouts and/or templates, it is time to apply some basic formatting to the report. In this section, we cover the following:

**1. Number formatting** - Inforiver comes prepackaged with _intelligent number formatting & scaling recognition_ capabilities which will be covered in [Number formatting](basic-formatting/number-formatting.md).

**2. Cell & value formatting** - In Inforiver, you can change the font color, style, size, and text alignment in a cell, or apply formatting effects. To learn more, refer to [Cell & value formatting](basic-formatting/cell-and-value-formatting.md).&#x20;

**3. Totals & subtotals** - Be it a typical table or a hierarchical matrix style report in Power BI, Inforiver allows you to seamlessly manage subtotals and grand totals in a couple of clicks. To learn more, refer to [Totals & subtotals](basic-formatting/totals-and-subtotals.md).

**4. Insert blank rows** - Financial statements and reports often require options to add white spaces for formatting. Inforiver provides the insert 'empty row' option to achieve this in a single click. To learn more, refer to [Insert blank rows](basic-formatting/insert-blank-rows.md).
