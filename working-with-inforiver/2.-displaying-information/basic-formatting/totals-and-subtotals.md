# Totals & subtotals

Be it a typical table or a hierarchical matrix style report in Power BI, Inforiver allows you to seamlessly manage subtotals and grand totals in a couple of clicks.

In this example, we have hierarchies across both rows & columns.

Note that

(a) the row subtotals (United States & International) are at the top, and

(b) the row grand total is the top&#x20;

(c) there are no subtotals and grand totals for columns.

### Customization options

Let us take a look at the customization options available in Inforiver.&#x20;

Click on the 'Totals' option in the Home tab Analyze section. There are options to enable/disable subtotals and totals and to change the positions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Row or/and column subtotals will appear only if there is a hierarchy in the row or/and column fields.
{% endhint %}

Let us make some changes as shown below. The corresponding changes in the matrix are highlighted in red.&#x20;

In the row subtotal section, you can see an option called 'Split'. Enable this and disable both the grand totals and the column subtotal.

Let us now look at the United States. There is a header row with no values, followed by a set of records. At the end of this section, the records are totalled.

In summary, Inforiver allows you to manage row & column subtotals & grand totals the way you want in an intuitive & flexible manner.

In the next section, we'll be covering [inserting empty rows](insert-blank-rows.md).
