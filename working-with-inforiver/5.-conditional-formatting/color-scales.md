# Color scales

Color scales option makes it very easy to visualize the values in a range of cells by applying a gradient color scale. Color scale can either be applied to the background or font with a single click. Five different formats of color scales are available Sequential, Qualitative, Diverging, Continuous, and Continuous-Diverging.
