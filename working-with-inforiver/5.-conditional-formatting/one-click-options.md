# One-click options

With Inforiver, you can perform various conditional formatting actions in a single click. Options include semantic formatting, color scales, segmentation, icons, ratings, data bars and many more.

A big benefit of the one-click setting is that you do not need to create rules from scratch. After you create a quick rule, you will have the option to customize it in a detailed manner if your report requires it.

### 1. Quick rule

Quick rule allows you to highlight the positive and negative values in the visual in a single click. Under 'Quick rule', there are two options - 'Positive' and 'Negative'.

{% hint style="info" %}
The one-click conditional formatting options are enabled only if a cell/column is selected.
{% endhint %}

a) Select a column. You can highlight values greater than or equal to zero in green by clicking on the 'Positive' option. &#x20;

b) Similarly, you can highlight values lesser than or equal to zero in red by clicking on the 'Negative' option.&#x20;

### 2. Color scales

A wide variety of color scales such as sequential, qualitative, diverging, continuous and continuous-diverging can be applied in a single click.&#x20;

a) Choose any column or cell and click on Conditional Formatting -> Color scales. Choose any of the color scales shown.

b) A sample heatmap using the sequential color scale is shown below. Notice that the font colors are automatically adjusted to be in contrast with their backgrounds for enhanced readability.

### 3. Classification

You can apply conditional formatting based on icons/ratings and even deliver ABC segmentations in a single click. As you click on 'Classification', you can see the following options.&#x20;

Let's look at an example for the three categories - Text, Icon set and Rating.

a) **Text**: Text-based classification is commonly used to categorize performance. A sample report with ABC classification is shown in the below image.

b) **Icons**: You can deliver conditional formatting using icons in a few clicks. Here is an example where items that contribute the most to sales are highlighted.

c) **Ratings**: You can use ratings such as the star-based ratings commonly seen in e-commerce sites in the product feedback section.&#x20;

### 4. Data bars

Data bars can be used to insert colored bars inside a cell to show how a given cell value compares to others.&#x20;

a) On clicking 'Data bars', you can see the following options. Select any of the options.

b) Data bars get added as shown in the image making it easy to spot the highest and lowest values at a glance.

You can use the side panel to further customize your rules. In the next section, we'll look at the [advanced options](create-rule-basic-settings.md).
