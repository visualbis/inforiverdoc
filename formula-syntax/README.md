# Formula syntax

Inforiver's Excel-like formula engine supports a wide range of functions (logical, boolean, math functions, and more). The formula editor provides syntax, examples, and features such as autocomplete, multi-line support, and more to help users create, and troubleshoot formulas.&#x20;

### Formula menu

You can use the formula menu to quickly locate the formula you are looking for. Click the _fx_ button to open the formula menu.

### Replicating formulas

Variance analysis or calculating depreciation or interest can involve using the same formula multiple times. An update to the formula would require opening and editing each visual column individually. You can use the **Copy to Column** option to replicate the formula across all columns. When you click the Copy to column icon, you will be able to select the visual columns across which the formula should be replicated.
