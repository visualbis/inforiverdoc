# CLOSEDPERIOD

The CLOSEDPERIOD function is used in conjunction with \[Forecast] to refer to the closed periods in a forecast. To refer to the open periods, use the NOT operator along with the CLOSEDPERIOD function.&#x20;

## Example

When you need to perform an action specific to the closed or open periods, you can use the .CLOSEDPERIOD along with existing functions and identifiers.

In the example below, we have added adjustment values to the open periods, and for the closed periods, we have marked them as 'closed'. This has been done using the conditional statement, [IF](../conditional-statements/).
