# ROW.PARENT

ROW.PARENT refers to the immediate parent. Note that chaining is possible.  ROW.PARENT.PARENT refers to the grandparent and so on.

## Example

We need to calculate the % Contribution of Phones -> East to Technology.

One way to calculate would be to select the 'East' row under Phones and divide it by the 'Technology' row.

Instead, we can use the reference 'Row.Parent.Parent'. Note that you can refer to the 'Phones' row by using 'Row.Parent'.

&#x20;In the below image, you can see that for 2016 Quantity, % Contribution is calculated as 46/219 resulting in 21%.&#x20;
