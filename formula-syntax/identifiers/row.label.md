# ROW.LABEL

ROW.LABEL can be used to access specific row values in the report. If the dataset contains a row hierarchy, ROW.LABEL can access all levels of the hierarchy.

## Example

Consider that we need to calculate the global contribution for the Juices and Mineral Water categories.&#x20;

In order to accomplish this, we need to first identify the rows with data for Juices and Mineral Water. This is where ROW.LABEL comes into play as shown in the image below.
