### 2. Manage Integrations

Integrating Inforiver with other applications allows it to list and upload files to them. You can connect or disconnect the applications from 'My Integrations' page. You can also manage them from the Onboard actions section, as explained [here](onboarding-actions.md).

If there are any interruptions in writeback or data retrieval from these applications, you can check the status of the connection from this page and disconnect and reconnect as needed.
