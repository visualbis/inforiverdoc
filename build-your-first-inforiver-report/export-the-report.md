# Export the report

To export an Inforiver visual to Excel or PDF, you will first have to publish the report to the Power BI service. If you need help publishing your report, [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-upload-desktop-files) Microsoft documentation covers the publishing steps. Once you have done that, open the report, and click on the Export tab. There you can export to PDF, Excel, or the clipboard.
