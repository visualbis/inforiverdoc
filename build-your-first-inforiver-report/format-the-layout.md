# Format the layout

Next, we need to make some changes to the overall layout and display. First, we want a little bit more room for the account descriptions. At the very top of the table, hover over the divider between the column headers. It should turn yellow when you do.

Drag the column divider to the right, just like you would in Word or Excel. This should give enough space to show the full descriptions.

After that, go to Home -> Analyze -> Total and turn off the grand total. We won’t be needing that for a P\&L Statement.

Next, go to Design -> Table -> Single Page to turn off pagination. For a report like this, it makes sense to have a scroll bar instead of separate pages. Usually a P\&L report isn’t very long unless you are viewing data at the more detailed levels.

Next, we want to hide the header. If you wanted to edit the contents of the header, you could either click on Design -> Layout -> Header and Footer, or double click on the header itself. In this case, we just want to hide it entirely. In that case, Hover over the header and you’ll see an eye icon with a slash through it. Click that icon to hide the header.

At this point, you’ve created a P\&L statement and applied some basic formatting. In the next section, we see some of the customization features that are unique to Inforiver.
