# Format the numbers

The first step is to format the numbers the way that you want. In this case, we want to show the numbers in millions with a single decimal point. Click on the header for the actuals column to select that column. It will turn blue when selected.

Next, click on the quick format dropdown of the Number section of the ribbon.

There you can select millions.

Then below the Quick Format dropdown, click in the decrease decimal button.

### Formatting the sign

Finally, we want to make sure that the data is correctly showing as positive or negative. This requires two steps, specifying the sign and influencing the totals.

In this case, we have a sign field in the data that has a 0 or a -1 to indicate whether the data is positive or negative. This is important because the answer can vary depending on what type of accounting analysis you are doing. Simply drag the sign field to the sign field well.

Next, we want to make sure that the sign affects the totals. So, on the ribbon go to Home -> Display -> Actions. Then click on the Display button. This will show you all the settings related to the general appearance of the visual.

Click on the numbers section and go down to the sign subsection. Turn on “Sign in Headers” and “Influence Total”. When you do so, “Show Positive Sign” and “Show Equal on Totals” will appear. Click those as well.

This will do two things. First, it will show the signs next to the headers which can make it easier to tell what type of value you are looking at. Second, the influence total setting will make sure that the negative values toll up to the total as such, instead of being for display purposes.
